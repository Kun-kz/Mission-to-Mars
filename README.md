# Mission to Mars

## Overview

In this project Mission to Mars, we built an app that could scrape different websites for data about Mars and created an accompanying HTML page to display the data. We scraped latest news about mars and its facts from NASA Mars News and Mars Facts. We also added more polish to it by finishing the challenge.

The following tasks were completed:

1. Scrape Mars hemisphere images and titles.
2. Update the Web App with Mars hemisphere images and titles.
3. Polish HTML page.

## Resources

- Software: Python, MongoDB, Flask

## Results

Our web app contained latest Mars news, Mars facts, featured Mars image and Mars hemispheres images and titles. By click on the “Scrape New Data” button, our website would scrape all latest data from different websites and display it.

We also set the “Scrape New Data” button color to green and added the hemisphere images as thumbnails.
